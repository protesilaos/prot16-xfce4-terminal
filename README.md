# Prot16 colour schemes for Xfce4 Terminal

"Prot16" is a collection of themes that use a 16-colour palette. Each item is available in distinct light and dark variants. For more, see https://protesilaos.com/schemes

## Installation

### Distro package

If you use Arch Linux or derivatives, you can get these themes from the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/prot16-xfce4-terminal/).

### With install script

Open a new terminal and add the following command. This will download and then run the install script. The script will copy all the `.theme` files into their relevant location, specifically `/usr/share/xfce4/terminal/colorschemes/`. It requires sudo privileges.

```shell
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/protesilaos/prot16-xfce4-terminal/master/install-prot16-xfce-terminal.sh | sh
```

## Removal

### With remove script

Run the following command

```shell
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/protesilaos/prot16-xfce4-terminal/master/remove-prot16-xfce-terminal.sh | sh
```

## Usage

Open the Xfce4 Terminal, navigate to `Preferences` > `Colours`. The themes should be available in the `Presets` section.
